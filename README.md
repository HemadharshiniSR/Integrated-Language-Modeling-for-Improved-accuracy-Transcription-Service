# Integrated-Language-Modeling-for-Improved-accuracy-Transcription-Service
This project implements a hybrid Speech Recognition and Natural Language Generation system. It transcribes spoken audio to text using the Google Web Speech API and enhances the resulting transcription using GPT-2, a language model from Hugging Face Transformers.


 Project Highlights
ðŸŽ¤ Transcribe speech from audio files (e.g., .wav)

ðŸ§½ Automatically improve transcription with GPT-2 for better readability or context

ðŸ¤– Uses Hugging Face's transformers for text enhancement

âœ… Easy to extend or integrate into other AI/NLP pipelines



ðŸš€ Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/hemadharshini/speech-transcription-gpt2.git
cd speech-transcription-gpt2

2. Install Dependencies
Install required Python packages:


pip install speechrecognition transformers torch
Optional (for microphone or more audio sources):
pip install pyaudio and pipwin install pyaudio (Windows only)

ðŸ§ª How It Works
Transcribe an audio file (.wav) using speech_recognition

Pass the raw transcription to a GPT-2 model for enhancement

Output both the original and the improved transcription

ðŸ“„ Example Usage
python

from transformers import pipeline
import speech_recognition as sr

recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
language_model = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2")

def transcribe_audio(audio_file):
    with sr.AudioFile(audio_file) as source:
        audio = recognizer.record(source)
    try:
        transcription = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
        print("Original Transcription:", transcription)
        return transcription
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print("Google Speech Recognition could not understand audio")
        return None
    except sr.RequestError as e:
        print(f"Could not request results from Google Speech Recognition service; {e}")
        return None

def improve_transcription(transcription):
    improved_text = language_model(transcription, max_length=200, num_return_sequences=1)[0]['generated_text']
    print("Improved Transcription:", improved_text)
    return improved_text

 Example call
audio_file = "hema_audio.wav"
transcription = transcribe_audio(audio_file)
if transcription:
    improve_transcription(transcription)
    
ðŸ¤– Why GPT-2?
Using GPT-2 allows the transcription to be contextually improved, making it:

More fluent

Better structured

Grammatically refined

Limitations
The system is not real-time.

GPT-2 may hallucinate or overextend content beyond the actual audio.

Internet connection is required for Googleâ€™s speech recognition service.

ðŸ”® Future Improvements
Integrate offline models for transcription (e.g., Vosk or Whisper)

Use fine-tuned GPT-2 or T5 for summarization or grammar correction

Add web or GUI interface
